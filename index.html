										Titanic Dataset Prediction</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/boat2.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/boat2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

										On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered "unsinkable" RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
										
										While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.</p>

										Yelp business review</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/yelp2.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/yelp2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this NLP project we want to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.

										Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user. The "stars" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review. The "cool" column is the number of "cool" votes this review received from other Yelp users. All reviews start with 0 "cool" votes, and there is no limit to how many "cool" votes a review can receive.</p>
